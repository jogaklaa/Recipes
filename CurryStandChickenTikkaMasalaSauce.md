## Ingredients

* 4 Cloves Garlic, minced
* 1 Tbsp Ground Cumin
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Ground Ginger
* 1 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp Ground Turmeric
* 1 (14 oz) Can Tomato Sauce
* 1 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream
* 2 tsp Paprika
* 1 Tbsp White Sugar
* 1 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
* 2 large chicken breast cut into bite-size pieces
* 1/2 tsp Curry Powder (I usually cover each batch as I cook them, def more then 1/2 tsp)
* 1/2 tsp Salt, or to taste (optional)
* 1 tsp White Sugar, or to taste (optional)

# Directions

1. Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until
translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant,
 about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon,
  and turmeric into the onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Stir tomato sauce into the onion and spice mixture, bring to a boil, and
reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, paprika,
 and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often,
  until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into
 the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned
  but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. Transfer chicken and any
   pan juices into the sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink,
    about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste.
