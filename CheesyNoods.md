# Pasta Twists With Tomato & Mozzarella
### (aka Cheesy Noods or Rotini)

## Ingredients
* 1/4 Cup Olive Oil
* 3 Cloves Garlic Minced
* 1 Can (14.5 oz) Italian-style Tomatoes
* 1/4 tsp Oregano Leaves
* 1/4 Cup Dry Red Wine
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/8 tsp Pepper

* 1/2 lb of a spiral noodle of your choice (I like rotini)
* 1 Cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese


## Directions
#### Sauce
1. Heat oil in pan over medium heat and add garlic
2. Once the garlic turns a pale golden brown, add tomatoes with their liquid, oregano, wine, salt, pepper and basil
  * Original Directions say to discard garlic after it browns
3. Adjust head so it comes to a gentle boil
4. Occasionally stir but let thicken for 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes (if desired)

#### Noodles
1. Get noodles started in large pot, cooking normally
2. After straining, return to the pot.
3. Mix mozzarella in as thoroughly as possible
4. Place some noodles onto a bowl/plate and cover with sauce.
