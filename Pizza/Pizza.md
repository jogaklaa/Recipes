# Pizza

## Ingredients

* Pizza Dough
* Pizza Sauce
* Low Moisture Mozzarella
* 2 to 3 Tbsp of Olive Oil
* Toppings of Choice

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 500Â°F or as high as it will go (might take a few pizzas to learn), and move a rack to the highest or second highest position
2. After waiting a few minutes get a 12-inch cast iron skillet heating on the stove on medium-high
3. While Things preheat stretch out the dough to roughly the shape of the skillet
4. Once the skillet is preheated add the olive oil in and then place the dough over it
5. Let the dough cook on its own for a few minutes, or until it is starting to show color on the under side
 * Note: Using a oiled wooden spoon can help push down the dough where it bubbles up
6. Add sauce with a ladle using the underside to spread it evenly over the dough
7. Sprinkle the mozzarella evenly over the pizza trying to avoid the cast iron edges
8. Top with other desired Ingredients
9. Move the cast iron skillet onto the top oven rack and leave in for at least 10 minutes, or until cheese is starting to brown
10. Remove cast iron from oven and then remove the pizza from the cast iron onto a cutting board to prevent the pizza cutter damage when cutting
